                    <p>Kid Safe Baby Proofing Service Professionals are trained to child proof homes and residential properties. Curious toddlers who want to touch and explore everything can inadvertently create havoc in a home. Some parents are content with the destruction. But it only takes an off-balance baby falling down the stairs and you instantly deeply regret not properly babyproofing your home. Better yet, contact Kid Safe Baby Proofing or <a id="contact-link" href="contact-us.html" target="_self">click here</a> to schedule a free consultation so we can better service your needs!</p>
                    <p>How far she should we really go to babyproof our homes? "Locks on cabinets? Locks on toilet seats? Outlet covers? Something to keep little fingers from being smashed in drawers or sliding doors? Knob covers for the stove? Gates? Lock on the refrigerator? Bubble-wrapped coffee table?". The answer is as safe as possible, without going overboard. Our services are for those recent or expecting mothers and fathers who want to make sure they have all possible areas of danger, to their children properly, babyproofed.
                    </p>
                    <p>The first step we take towards babyproofing your home is to assess your child's personality and your needs. For instance, if your home has a pool or wood stove, you will want to make sure there's a gate around them. It also helps to observe your child and see if you can determine what unsafe things will be an attraction. For example, some moms are forced to put up a protection system around the TV when they find their children are obsessed with pushing its buttons. Other moms say they don't use commonly purchased outlet protectors because their children aren't infatuated with their home's outlets. <a id="contact-link" href="babyproofing-blog.html" target="_self">Click here</a> to read more about babyproofing on our new blog!

                    <h3>Bare Minimum Babyproofing In Your Home</h3>
                    <p>At the very least we recommend babyproofing corners that children could accidentally bump into, putting safety latches on doors, and locking cabinets with unsafe items. We will assess whether other areas of her home warrant more babyproofing in your consultation. In addition, we urge our customers to opt for door knob covers, outlet plugs, and safety catches to prevent a child from opening doors and getting into food or even your cat's litter. We take everything into perspective when making your home <strong>Kid Safe!</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>During installation we pay special attention and to products with unsafe ingredients that you may not know are toxic. Many products out there, from baby shampoos, to lotions, to dish washing soap, to detergent for laundry are all very poisonous to your little ones. Baby proofing doesn't only mean wall plugs, and sharp items way up high. That is exactly why when you purchase our babyproofing services, we will take special precautions with your household and personal care items and create awareness with the loving parents we service. There are so many toxic ingredients out there that cause mild to serious health problems short-term and long-term, for our children, that we can help you prevent." lets in her home after her son stuck an ornament hanger in one.</p>
